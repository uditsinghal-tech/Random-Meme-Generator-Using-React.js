# Random-Meme-Generator-Using-React.js
Using the react.js technology I made a project called random meme generator. In this a project a perfect blend of function based and class based components has been used. API call is used to collect a wide variety of images so that they can be used to generate memes. A form is provided where user can enter the text he wish to display on the images which is displayed using the state variables. Event Listener is provided on a button which when clicked changes the images being displayed. Hence the user will be able to decide which image he choses as meme and then write text on it.
